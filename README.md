# Freeroam Scripts

This is an archive of the scripts used for my multiplayer sandbox game "Freeroam".

Some highlights:

- [PlayerController.cs](/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs) - lots of core gameplay code, hacking around Unity utils
- [PlayerState.cs](/Scripts/Player/PlayerState.cs) - player state machine
- [NetworkVehicle.cs](/Scripts/Vehicles/NetworkVehicle.cs) - some more general gameplay code

Freeroam was one of my first Unity/C# projects. Code quality will reflect as much.

Regardless, I'm quite happy with the progress I made in the span of a few weeks. Code left here is old, used at your own risk, etc.
